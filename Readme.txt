Internship summary

In this project, you will help them automate a task they perform twice a month when new employees join the company. 

Each employee has to set up their own laptop. To start, they receive their work email address and a password that they can only use once. The manager creates the spreadsheet with the data that will then be used to send each new employee their login credentials.

In developing the automation you'll use the following input files, websites, and applications:

NewJoiners.xlsx - The workbook contains the email addresses for the new joiners. In column D you'll have to write the generated password.
Password Generator - You'll use this website to generate the passwords.
citizen.developer@uipath.com - This is the email address which will receive the final Excel file.

In the Zip file below, you'll find the input document.
